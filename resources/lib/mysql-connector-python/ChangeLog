MySQL Connector/Python - Release Notes / ChangeLog
Copyright (c) 2009, 2012, Oracle and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.

1.0.7 (2012-08-19)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed formatting of client errors changing numeric to string
  placeholders. (BUG#14548043)
    * Client and server errors have been regenerated using latest
      development release of MySQL v5.6.6.

1.0.6-beta (2012-08-28)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed Python v3 code so it works with Python v3.3. (BUG#14524942)

- Fixed MySQLCursorRaw.fetchall() to not raise when results are available.
  This was only a problem in the Python v3 code. (BUG#14517262, BUG#66465)

- Changed name and version of distributions to align with other MySQL
  projects (WL#6450)
    * The version now includes the suffix 'b' for beta and 'a' for alpha
      followed by a number. This version is used in the source and built
      distributions. GA versions will have no suffix.
    * The RPM spec files have been updated to create packages which names
      are aligned with RPMs from other MySQL projects.

- Fixed installation of version.py on OS X. (BUG#14483142)
    * version.py is now correctly installed on OS X in the mysql.connector
      package. Previously it was installed through data_files, and version.py
      ended up in the system wide package location of Python from where it
      could not be imported.
    * data_files is not used any longer in setup.py and is removed. Extra
      files like version.py are now copied in the custom Distutils
      commands.

- Fixed SSL unit testing for source distributions. (BUG#14402737)
    * The SSL keys and certificates were missing and have been added to
      the source distribution. Now SSL testing works properly.
    * Additionally for the Windows platform, forward slashes had to
      be added to the option file creation so the MySQL server can
      pickup the needed SSL files.

- Timeout for unit tests has been set to 10 seconds. Test cases can
  individually adjust it to be higher or lower. (BUG#14487502)

- Fixed test cases in test_mysql_database.py which failed when using
  using YEAR(2) with MySQL v5.6.6 and greater. (BUG#14460680)

- Changed how MySQL server errors are mapped to Python exceptions. We now
  use the SQLState (when available) to raise a better error. (WL#6412)
    * Incompatibility: some server errors are now raised with a different
      exception.
    * It is possible to override how errors are raised using the
      mysql.connector.custom_error_exception() function, defined in
      the mysql.connector.errors module. This can be useful for certain
      frameworks to align with other database drivers.

1.0.5-beta (2012-07-17)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Added SQL Modes as constants, making it easier to use them (WL#6411)
    * Setting the SQL Modes meant that developers had to make sure the
      string passed to MySQL was correctly formatted and contains the correct
      modes. To make it easier, a new class constants.SQLMode containing all
      the SQL Modes was added: for example, constants.SQLMode.TRADITIONAL will
      return the string 'TRADITIONAL'.
    * Additionally, MySQLConnection.sql_mode property now accepts a sequence of
      SQL Modes. For example, to set 2 SQL Modes, you can do the following
      cnx.sql_mode = [SQLMode.REAL_AS_FLOAT, SQLMode.NO_ZERO_DATE]

- Added descriptive error codes for both client and server errors (WL#6351)
    * The errorcode module contains client and server error codes which can
      be used instead of the error numbers. For example,
      errorcode.CR_CONNECTION_ERROR is 2002.
    * A new locales sub-package has been created in mysql.connector. This will
      provided localized content. The first support language is the default
      English and contains the client error messages: locales.eng.client_error.
      To retrieve a client error based on the error number or code (name) you
      can use the get_client_error() function importing it from locales:
      from mysql.connector.locales import get_client_error()
    * Error messages and error codes are automatically fetch from the latest
      development release of MySQL. The errorcode.py and all files in the
      locales package are generated. You can see the generation date and the
      version of MySQL which was used in those files.

1.0.4-alpha (2012-07-08)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Redundant MySQLConnection methods unset_client_flag() and set_client_flag()
  have been removed. Use set_client_flags() using a sequence of flags to
  change the client flags. (BUG#14259996)

- Greatly simplified setting and retrieving character set and collation
  information (BUG#14260052):
    * Incompatible change: MySQLConnection's set_charset() has been replaced
      by the method set_charset_collation() with which it is possible to set
      character set and collation. The properties collation and charset are
      now read-only.

- Fixed MySQLCursor.executemany() when INSERT statements use the
  'ON DUPLICATE KEY'-clause with a function like VALUES() (BUG#14259954)

- Fixing unit testing on the MS Windows platform (BUG#14236592)
    * tests/mysqld.py has been updated to make sure Windows binaries are
      looked up. Also, backslashes are now replaced by double forward
      slashes in the option file.
    * Bootstrapping is done using --no-defaults and we make sure that
      --standalone is used when launching mysqld.exe on Windows.
    * examples/dates.py has been updated to produce more predictable
      output and to work in environments where SQL Modes are set by
      default, for example, MySQL installation on Windows.
    * Some unit test have been update for Windows.

- Converting a datetime.time for MySQL failed for Python v2.4/2.5
  because strftime() has no support for the %f mark (BUG#14231941)

- cursor.CursorBase attributes description, lastrowid and rowcount are now
  read-only properties. This change was needed to to comply with Python's
  DB API v2.0 specification or PEP-249. (BUG#14231160)

- Server error 1426 has been classified as ProgrammingError for
  MySQL 5.6.4 and later (BUG#14201459)
    * Additionally, the unit tests will now show the actual version of the
      MySQL server being bootstrapped and started. The version is also
      available to all tests.

- MySQLConnection.cmd_query() could and can not handle multiple statements.
  There for, a new method cmd_query_iter() has been introduced which will
  return an generator object to iterate through results. To prevent
  duplication of functionality/code, we made a few changes to the
  cursors in the cursor module. Here is a list of what is new and
  incompatible changes (BUG#14208326):
    * MySQLConnection.cmd_query() will raise an error when multiple
      statements are given; cmd_query_iter() should be used.
    * MySQLCursor.execute() returns a generator object with which you can
      iterate over results when executing multiple statements. Previously
      it returned -1 or the row count. MySQLCursor.execute() yields True
      when there are rows available (for example, after a SELECT), or False
      when no rows need to be or can be fetched.
    * The method MySQLCursor.next_resultset() has been removed since you
      can now iterate through results using MySQLCursor.execute().
    * The method MySQLCursor.next_proc_result() has been renamed to
      MySQLCursor.proc_results() and returns a generator object.
    * MySQLCursor.statement will return the executed statement.
    * MySQLCursor.with_rows returns True when there is result which could
      return rows (which has columns definitions returned by MySQL).
    * The multiple_resultset.py example shows how to go through results
      produced by sending multiple statements.

- MySQLConnection.cmd_query() and other methods sending server commands
  did not take into consideration that there might be unread results. This
  could possibly lead to wrong results and the application waiting forever.
  (BUG#14184643)

1.0.3-alpha (2012-06-08)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Facilitate the creation of source and built distributions (WL#6250)
    * New Distutils commands for creating packages. Every command can be
      given with the setup script, `python setup.py <command>`. These
      commands are a good base for later adding more distribution types.
      All commands are either specific to a particular Python minor version
      or major version (that is Python 2.x or Python 3.x).
    * sdist_gpl: GPLv2 distribution created in a folder in dist/. This is
      the base command for other GPLv2 source distributions.
    * bdist_com: Commercial distribution created in a folder in dist/. This
      the base command for other commercial built distributions. Before
      the source byte-compiled and removed, the GPL license is removed.
    * sdist_gpl_msi: Based on command sdist_gpl, it creates a Windows
      Installer installing a source distribution using WiX v3.5 (see
      support/MSWindows).
    * bdist_com_msi: Based on command bdist_com, it creates a Windows
      Installer installing a commercial built distribution
      using WiX v3.5 (see support/MSWindows).
    * sdist_gpl_rpm: Based on command sdist_gpl, it creates an architecture
      independent, but Python version specific, source distribution
      using a RPM spec file (see support/RPM).
    * bdist_com_rpm: Based on command bdist_com, it creates a architecture
      independent, but Python version specific, built distribution
      using a RPM spec file (see support/RPM).
    * There is an additional command to make Egg, but this proved to be not
      working due to the fact that Connector/Python is installed in a folder
      or package used by other projects (like MySQL Utilities). We, however,
      leave the code as it might be useful later.
    * The support/ directory is not part of any distribution and the setup.py
      will silently ignore when the extra Distutils commands are not
      available.
    * The distribution name of the Connector/Python (metasetupinfo.py) has
      changed from MySQL-Connector-Python to MySQL_Connector_Python to avoid
      problems installing using easy_install and others.
    * The docs/ directory now contains placeholder files for various
      documentation formats which will be part of the distribution later. We
      added these to facilitate the development and testing of the extra
      Distutils commands.
    * We removed the support/make_release.py script because we now use the
      Distutils. The file _version.py has been renamed to version.py so it
      can be imported without to much problems as it is also part of the
      distributions.
  
- Adding support for time values with a fractional part (WL#6149)
    * In MySQL 5.6.4, the fractional part of DATETIME, TIME, and TIMESTAMP
      values can be stored (provided the table schema supports it). 
      Connector/Python will send the fractional part and read it from results.
      Support is transparent and there is no extra option needed to enable
      this feature.
    * The new example script microseconds.py was added showing how to use
      Connector/Python to save and read TIME values with a fractional part.

1.0.2-alpha (2012-05-19)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Adding missing unittests (WL#6069):
    * Adding missing unit tests for important modules like connection and
      network.
    * SSL wasn't tested and the bootstrapped MySQL server can now setup
      secure connections using certificates and keys found in the
      /support/ssl folder of the source.
    * Some bugs around SSL have been found and fixed together with some
      refactoring.
    * Some code in mysql.connector.connection has been refactored or removed.

- Fixing and refactoring the mysql.connector.errors module (BUG#14039339):
    * class ClientError has been removed. The client error messages are
      now found in errors._CLIENT_ERROR and the function returning the
      MySQL Client error message is named errors._get_mysql_client_error.
    * Some server errors were incorrectly or classified twice.
    * errors.raise_error will raise a ValueError when the packet does not
      contain a MySQL error.
    * Removed Python mapping keys from client error messages
      in _CLIENT_ERROR.
    * The SQLState returned by MySQL errors were not reported in the
      raised exceptions.
    * Unit tests were missing for the errors module and have been added.

- Bootstrapping MySQL v5.6 running unittests have been fixed. (BUG#14048685)
    * A semicolon was missing issuing the USE command when loading the
      system table when bootstrapping. It seems that this is a problem
      with more recent MySQL versions.
    * STDOUT and STDERR when bootstrapping and starting the MySQL server
      for unittest testing is being redirected to devnull.
    * There is now an info logger line when we bootstrap and when we start
      the MySQL server. This should help showing at which state has been
      reached.


1.0.1-alpha (2012-04-26)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Updating copyright notice and license: the FLOSS License Exception is
  now explicitly mentioned in all source files. (WL#6273)

- The version does only contain integers now. The 'a' or 'alpha' suffix will
  not be present in packages, but it will be mentioned in the _version.py
  module since metasetupinfo.py uses this information to set, for example,
  the Trove classifiers dynamically.

1.0.0-alpha (2012-04-22)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Preparation for first Alpha release in the MySQL Connector/Python v1.0
  series (WL#6273):
    * _version.py was removed from the mysql.connector package and moved
      now only used when installing and making packages.
    * The README and AUTHORS files have been updated. The ChangeLog has
      been revamped to included only v1.0 releases.
    * Documentation is moving to the MySQL manual: contains of docs/ folder
      has been removed and for now replaced by a README.
    * metasetupinfo.py has been updated.
    * The make_release.py script has been updated and moved to the subfolder
      support/.
    * MANIFEST.in does not include setup.cfg anymore.

- The metasetupinfo.py was using the already installed modules of
  Connector/Python instead of the ones going to be installed. This meant that
  upgrading would haven't worked when new modules would have been added.
  The metasetupinfo.py now alters the sys.path to make sure the to be
  installed modules are loaded first. (BUG#13962765)

- Refactoring the modules connection and protocol (WL#6196):
    * Moving socket classes connection to the new module 
      mysql.connector.network.
    * The MySQLProtocol class does not keep a reference to a 
      MySQLConnection-object any more. MySQLProtocol is now only dealing
      with creating and parsing MySQL packets. Network interaction is now
      done only by the MySQLConnection objects with the exception of the
      MySQLProtocol.read_text_result, which needs a socket object to be
      passed.
    * MySQLConnection handles handshaking, authentication,
      OK/EOF packets and Error packets, all which was done previously by the
      MySQLProtocol class.
    * Packet numbers are now tracked by network.BaseMySQLSocket. This was
      previously done by MySQLProtocol.

- MySQLCursor.description now stores column names as Unicode (BUG#13792575).

- The dbapi.Binary is now bytes for Python v3 (BUG#13780676)

- Fixed automatic garbage collection which caused memory usage to grow
  over time. (Bug#13435186)
    * MySQLConverter uses getattr() instead of mapping types and methods in
      a dictionary.
    * MySQLCursor keeps a weak reference to the MySQLConnection object that
      created it.
    * MySQLConnection does not keep track of its cursors any longer.
    * Some changes where reworked with refactoring the connection and
      protocol modules. (WL#6196)

- Implemented reconnect and fixed the ping()-method (BUG#13392739)
    * MySQLConnection.reconnect() can be used to reconnect to the MySQL
      server. It accepts number of retries and an optional delay between
      attempts.
    * MySQLConnectiong.ping() is now a method and works the way the MySQL
      C API mysql_ping() function works: it raises an error. It can also
      optionally reconnect.
    * MySQLConnection.is_connected() now returns True when connection is
      available, False otherwise.
    * ping() and is_connected() are backwards incompatible.

- Fixed setting time zone for current MySQL session. (BUG#13395083)

- Fixed setting and retrieving character set and collation. (Bug#13375632)
    * Setting the character set using the MySQLConnection charset property
      or set_charset() method can now be done in 3 ways: using MySQL's ID,
      using a name or using a tuple with second element the collation.
    * Setting the collation will retrieve and reset MySQLConnection's
      _charset_id attribute to the correct character set.
    * The MySQLConnection.charset_name and MySQLConnection.collation_name
      properties can be used to retrieve respectively the character set and
      the collation name.

- Fixed setting sql_mode to a list of modes. (BUG#13365985)

- Fixed handling of errors after authentication for Python v3 (BUG#13364285)

- Various improvements around receiving and sending MySQL packets:
    * Refactored MySQLBaseSocket.recv_plain and
      MySQLBaseSocket.recv_compressed: they are now simpler and handle socket
      errors better.
    * Using sendall() for sending packets.
