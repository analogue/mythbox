'''Filesystem-based object store

shove's psuedo-URL for filesystem-based stores follows the form:

file://<path>

Where the path is a URL path to a directory on a local filesystem.
Alternatively, a native pathname to the directory can be passed as the 'engine'
argument.

from shove import BaseStore, FileBase

__all__ = ['FileStore']


class FileStore(FileBase, BaseStore):

    '''File-based store.'''    
    
    def __init__(self, engine, **kw):
        super(FileStore, self).__init__(engine, **kw)
